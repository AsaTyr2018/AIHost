# AIHost

AIHost aims to be a simple, automated Docker manager for running
machine‑learning projects. Repositories are registered via a web
interface, installed on demand and executed inside containers built from
a default AI‑ready base image.

The high level design is described in [docs/concept.md](docs/concept.md).
See `AGENTS.md` for coding conventions and project structure.
